## Overview
Using the "Movies Dataset" from Kaggle, this project will create an optimal model for predicting a movie's financial success.

A set of features that would only be known prior to a movies release will be used. A classifier for predicting success will be developed based on a revenue_to_budget ratio as the threshold.

The feature set will be further assessed via an optimal regression algorithm to predict revenue, where a low RMSE will increase confidence in the feature engineering and feature selection for the classifier.
